# OS-Multi-programming-Batch-System

In a multi-programmed batch system, the CPU will never be idle. The Operating System keeps multiple jobs in the main memory, these are the jobs waiting to be executed. The Operating System will choose one of these jobs and begins execution. Once this job needs an I/O operation, the Operating System switches to another job. If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the Operating System chooses which one to run through the process of CPU Scheduling.

This project was implemented using java, it was a group project for Operating Systems course
